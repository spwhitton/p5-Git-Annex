=head1 SYNOPSIS

  # you should not instantiate this class yourself; use Git::Annex::batch
  my $annex = Git::Annex->new("/home/spwhitton/annex");
  my $batch = $annex->batch("find", "--not", "--in=here");

  # see git-annex-find(1) -- `git annex find --batch --not --in here`
  # prints an empty string for each file which is not present
  say "foo/bar is not present in this repo" if $batch->say("foo/bar");

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class can be used to run git-annex commands which take the
C<--batch> option.  You can feed the command lines of input and you
will get back git-annex's responses.

The main point of using C<--batch> commands from Perl is to keep
git-annex running rather than repeatedly executing new git-annex
processes to perform queries or request changes.

=method new($annex, $cmd, @args)

Initialise a batch process in Git::Annex C<$annex>, running git-annex
subcommand C<$cmd> (e.g. C<setpresentkey>) with arguments C<@args>.

You should use Git::Annex::batch in preference to this method.

=cut

sub new {
    my (undef, $annex, $cmd, @params) = @_;
    croak "not enough arguments to Git::Annex::BatchCommand constructor"
      unless $annex and $cmd;

    # normalise supplied arguments a little
    unshift @params, "--batch" unless grep /\A--batch\z/, @params;

    my $self = bless { _annex => $annex, _cmd => [$cmd, @params] }
      => "Git::Annex::BatchCommand";
    $self->_spawn;
    return $self;
}

=method say($input, ...)

Say a line or lines of input to the batch command's standard input.
Trailing line breaks in C<$input> are optional.

In list context, returns a list of git-annex's responses to the items
of input, chomped.  In scalar context, returns the last of git-annex's
responses, chomped.

=cut

sub say {
    my ($self, @input) = @_;
    my @output;
    for (@input) {
        chomp;
        say { $self->{_in} } $_;
        chomp(my $out = readline $self->{_out});
        push @output, $out;
    }
    return wantarray ? @output : $output[$#output];
}

=method ask($input, ...)

Synonym for C<say> method.

=cut

*ask = \&say;

=method restart

Kill and restart the C<--batch> command.

This is sometimes needed to ensure the C<--batch> command picks up
changes made to the git-annex branch.

=cut

sub restart {
    my $self = shift;
    $self->_despawn;
    $self->_spawn;
}

sub _spawn {
    my $self = shift;
    my ($out, $in);
    $self->{_pid} = open2 $out, $in, "git",
      "-C", $self->{_annex}->toplevel,
      "annex", @{ $self->{_cmd} };
    ($self->{_out}, $self->{_in}) = ($out, $in);
}

sub _despawn {
    my $self = shift;
    close $self->{_in};
    close $self->{_out};
    # reap the child per IPC::Open2 docs
    waitpid $self->{_pid}, 0;
}

sub DESTROY { local($., $@, $!, $^E, $?); shift->_despawn }
